 A rent a car application using mongodb

I have done it using java web application and mongo db. Because of which pushing in heroku is not possible as heroku needs maven project. Start from addcar.html and I have used tom cat server. You can watch the full working of my project on demo_whitepanda.mp4 video which is uploaded here.
